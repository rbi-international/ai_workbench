{"response": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which itself is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI). It focuses on using neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to model and understand complex patterns in large amounts of data. These neural networks are inspired by the human brain's structure and function, though they are much simpler and more abstract.\n\nHere are some key characteristics and components of deep learning:\n\n1. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning models are often built using artificial neural networks,", "inference_time": 2.044349193572998}
