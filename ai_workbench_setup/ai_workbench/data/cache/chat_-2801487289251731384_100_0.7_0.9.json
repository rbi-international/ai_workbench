{"response": "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn and make decisions based on data. The core idea is to allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on past experiences or available information.\n\nKey aspects of machine learning include:\n\n1. **Data Input:** Machine learning models are trained on large datasets. The quality and quantity of data significantly affect the performance of", "inference_time": 2.842282295227051}
