{"response": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead of being programmed to follow specific rules, machine learning systems learn from data to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve over time.\n\nThere are several types of machine learning:\n\n1. **Supervised Learning**: In this type, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label.
