{"response": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). It is based on artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning models are designed to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks.\n\nHere are some key characteristics and components of deep learning:\n\n1. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to model complex patterns in", "inference_time": 3.8266046047210693}
