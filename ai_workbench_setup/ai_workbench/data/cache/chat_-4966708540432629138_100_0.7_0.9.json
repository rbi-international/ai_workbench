{"response": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead of being manually programmed to execute a specific task, machine learning models learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.\n\nThe primary goal of machine learning is to identify patterns or regularities in data through a process that typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gathering and organizing relevant data that will be used for training the model", "inference_time": 3.128739833831787}
