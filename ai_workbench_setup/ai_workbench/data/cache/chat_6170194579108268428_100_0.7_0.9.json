{"response": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. It is based on artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning models are designed to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks.\n\nKey characteristics of deep learning include:\n\n1. **Neural Networks:** Deep learning models use layers of interconnected nodes, or \"neurons,\" which process input data to generate output. These networks are typically", "inference_time": 2.7769689559936523}
