{"response": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead of being programmed with specific rules to follow, machine learning systems learn from data. This process involves training a model on a dataset, which helps the system make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.\n\nKey components of machine learning include:\n\n1. **Data**: Machine learning requires large amounts of data to train models effectively.
