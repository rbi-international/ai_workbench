{"response": "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following predetermined instructions, these systems learn from data to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve over time.\n\nKey aspects of machine learning include:\n\n1. **Data Input:** Machine learning systems require large datasets to learn from. This data can be structured (like databases) or unstructured (like images or text).\n\n2. **Algorithms", "inference_time": 2.5358567237854004}
